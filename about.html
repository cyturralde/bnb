Board sailing is also popular. Wrightsville's Beach Ocean Association provides organized sailboat racing for yachts, both in cruising or racing class, with the season lasting from April to October. The intracoastal waterway minutes from our home slices off the eastern portion of Southeastern North Carolina and links Cape Fear country with the world. Surf fishing is also popular and fishing piers dot the shores. Boats can be rented for offshore fishing trips or a run to the Gulf Stream. Saltwater fishing is enjoyable in the river and lakes if prefered. There are unlimited golf courses in the area if that's your game. Its also worth mentioning we have the annual Azalea Musical Festival in Wilmington which is very popular. Come and enjoy what the region has to offer.</p>
